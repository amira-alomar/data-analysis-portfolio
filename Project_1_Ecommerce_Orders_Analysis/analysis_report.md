1. Overall Performance

Total orders: 47,544

Completed orders: 56%

Cancelled orders: 36%

Revenue lost due to cancellations: ~34%


The cancellation rate is abnormally high and has a direct, material impact on revenue.
Most unshipped orders overlap with cancelled orders, indicating operational breakdowns rather than demand issues.


---

2. Geographic Performance

Top 5 states generate ~54% of total orders and revenue.

41 low-volume states contribute only ~5.36% of orders.

The same states dominate orders, revenue, cancellations, and unshipped orders.


This indicates strong geographic concentration and suggests that operational problems scale with volume rather than being location-specific.


---

3. Monthly & Category Behavior

Cancellations peak in April, May, and June.

Top 5 categories account for ~99% of quantity and revenue.

Product-level revenue is highly fragmented: top 5 products generate only ~6% of total revenue.


The business relies heavily on a few categories, while revenue is spread thin across many SKUs.

4. Fulfillment, Shipping & Channels

Easy Ship generates 100% of revenue despite handling ~76% of orders.

Amazon fulfillment accounts for ~23% of orders but 0 recorded revenue.

Amazon and expedited shipping dominate cancelled and unshipped orders (>60% and >90% respectively).


This strongly suggests either:

data quality issues, or

serious fulfillment and reporting failures.

5. Data Quality Observations

Zero revenue for certain fulfillment and shipping types is not realistic.

Some fields required assumptions or cleaning to remain usable.

Analysis explicitly highlights these issues instead of hiding them.


Recognizing and documenting data limitations reflects real-world analytics practice.


---

6. Business Recommendations (Summary)

Investigate fulfillment and shipping pipelines with high cancellation rates.

Validate revenue recording for Amazon and expedited orders.

Focus operations and inventory on top-performing states and categories.

Improve data validation processes before downstream reporting.

Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:

End-to-end analysis (cleaning → analysis → insight → recommendation)

Critical thinking around inconsistent data

Business-oriented interpretation, not just charts
