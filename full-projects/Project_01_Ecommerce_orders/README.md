E-Commerce Orders & Revenue Analysis

The goal is to identify operational issues, revenue leakage, and concentration risks, and to provide data-driven recommendations.

Key Findings

High cancellation rate (36%) resulted in ~34% revenue loss.

Orders and revenue are highly concentrated in a small number of states (Top 5 ≈ 54%).

Fulfillment and shipping issues are the main drivers of cancellations and unshipped orders.

A small set of categories dominates sales (~99% of quantity and revenue).

Data inconsistencies exist (e.g., zero revenue for some fulfillment/shipping types), highlighting data quality challenges.
